#! /usr/bin/env bash
#
# A small wrapper around our stdout-sendmail program which unsets
# COVERAGE_PROCESS_START prior to calling it. The purpose is to disable
# code coverage prior to calling this script, because leaving it enabled
# causes a fatal error while trying to save the coverage data into a file
# at the end of the script's execution (during the atexit call). The error
# comes from the fact that the git-hooks daemonizes the execution of
# the call to sendmail, which results in the process changing its current
# working directory to /, and thus causes the coverage module to think
# that it should save its coverage data files there, resulting in
# an IOError:
#
#    IOError: [Errno 13] Permission denied: '/.coverage.xxx.189363.572044'
